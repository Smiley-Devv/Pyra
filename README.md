### 🚧 Status
Right now… it *kinda doesn’t work yet* 😅.  
Think of this repo as a sneak peek. Improvements are on the way!

### ✨ Vision
Pyra aims to be:
- A fun experiment in building a programming language from scratch.
- A playground for learning about lexers, parsers, and compilers.
- A project that grows as I learn.

### 📅 Roadmap
- [ ] Lexer (tokenizer) 📝  
- [ ] Parser 📚  
- [ ] AST + Evaluator 🌳  
- [ ] Maybe a REPL 🤔  
- [ ] Profit 🚀
